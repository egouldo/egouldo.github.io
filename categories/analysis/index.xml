      <description>WORK IN PROGRESS – DRAFT Problem:
Have you ever done this… if so, how many times have you done this? Frequency of engagement among researchers.

Tells us about how common these practices are. If it’s a common practice, and/or, if people are doing this repeatedly, then it’s likely that this is a more acceptabile practice (THAT person should have rated the practice as being defensible, and it’s likely that the broader sample of researchers will also think that the practice is more acceptible).</description>
