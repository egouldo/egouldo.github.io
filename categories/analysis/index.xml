      <description>Status: WORK IN PROGRESS – DRAFT Problem 1: Estimating the percentage of researchers who engage in a particular QRP provides some information about the extent of the practice, and its potential impact on the literature. However, it doesn’t allow us to get an estimate of how many studies or papers might have been affected by this QRP – this is what we really care about, and the proportion of researchers engaging in a practice will not translate very accurately (or precisely) to the proportion of the literature effected.</description>
