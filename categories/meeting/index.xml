      <description>Session Planning Focus: Reproducibility in practice - QRPs.
Session aim: To help spread awareness among Qaecologists and Cebranalysts about reproducibility issues in our research practices. And then possibly provide people with the tools / solutions to overcome some of these issues.
Format: not a lecture, not an unstructured discussion.
Length 90 minutes.
Introduction: 15 minutes Introductory talk with a few slides . Led by Fiona and Hannah.
Intro by Fiona, perhaps talking about why reproducibility is important to us as ecologists, the state of reproducibility in eco/evo, an in the context of other dsciplines?</description>

      <description>Planning the projects and the scope of the Phd (and the format for the thesis):
 Perfectly acceptable to have disparate projects / papers comprising the thesis, and bound together with a good introduction and conclusion. Don’t have to choose between different projects.  Good to try and sit with that tension, and not having to resolve it by having a neat / tightly fitting narrative thesis.

      <description>To date:
Have been trying to determine the scope of the project. Want to look at the reproducibility of decision support tools
 what elements of existing reproducibility literature apply to this context?
 do we need a new set of criteria? Much of the repro literature especially in ecology seems to be focused on NHST, but this statistical tool is rarely used in decision science, instead it might often rely on the outputs of other studies that utilise them.</description>

      <description>See Steve&amp;rsquo;s guidelines around meta-analysis from medicine. Hannah&amp;rsquo;s criteria. Conservation Biology guidelines. Guidelines / checkpoints are just around transparency. No actual checking of reproducibility.
How do decisions vs. models differ? What is particular about my problem context? values, preferences. Process vs. decision model - problem is often split into two. Decision tools as models more complex, involve not just a model of the system / domain (including decision elements), but capturing objectives, alternatives, eliciting expert judgment, involving many stakeholders.</description>

      <description>Guerrero, A. M., Shoo, L., Iacona, G., Standish, R. J., Catterall, C. P., Rumpff, L., de Bie, K., White, Z., Matzek, V., Wilson, K. A. (2017) Using structured decision-making to set restoration objectives when multiple values and preferences exist. Restoration Ecology. 25, 858–865.
Problem: achieving restoration targets is impeded by difficulty in identifying and working towards targets, because objective setting is beset by multiple / conflicting values and preferences, and there are often time-lags in a restoration action and its desired outcome.</description>

      <description>activities -&amp;gt; working towards the research proposal -&amp;gt; also on first chapter
Reading: - trying to identify difficulties / issues in modelling applied ecological problems in general - e.g. projecting performance of conservation actions, building the evidence base in restoration ecology as new techniques emerge.
-&amp;gt; aims, trying to identify why reproducibility is important for ecological models / DSTs
defining reproducibility for ecological models (still need to justify this)</description>
