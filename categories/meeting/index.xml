      <description>Present: HF, LR, EG.
Divying up the Thesis Stepping back after a couple of talks and much RA-ing… Today we discussed the division of the QRP research material I have been working on in terms of research outputs / papers. We then discussed the overall plan for the thesis, and reflected back on the original plan discussed at the pre-confirmation meeting.
The QRP material is to be divided into two papers:</description>

      <description>Tasks from last week: Develop QRP list across all methods. Figure out what is general between each of the methods. Then come up with a list of QRPs specific to the method under consideration. Also think about the overarching decision / analytic process for each of the methods. Could the QRP occur at multiple points along the workflow / model building pipeline? Sampling protocol - begin writing code, journal selection. Think about elicitation measures, what they could be, and how they could be the same across each of the methods  Other things to discuss today:</description>

      <description>Survey Sampling Design FF queried elicitation of non-experts about the prevalence of QRPs across methods they were familiar with, but hadn’t implemented themselves. Encouraged solid justification for doing this. The only reason that comes to mind for her is if increasing the sample size is the aim. But otherwise, QRP research seems to show that people are particularly forthcoming when it comes to self-reporting. So any arguments about issues around self-reporting affecting the prevalence estimates are basically moot.</description>

If researchers:
 can compare the number of estimated vs. self-reported? Some interesting questions about whether self reporters estimate the prevalence to be greater than non-self reporters, is the self reported rate lower than the estimated rate?</description>

      <description>Session Planning Focus: Reproducibility in practice - QRPs.
Session aim: To help spread awareness among Qaecologists and Cebranalysts about reproducibility issues in our research practices. And then possibly provide people with the tools / solutions to overcome some of these issues.
Format: not a lecture, not an unstructured discussion.
Length 90 minutes.
Introduction: 15 minutes Introductory talk with a few slides . Led by Fiona and Hannah.
Intro by Fiona, perhaps talking about why reproducibility is important to us as ecologists, the state of reproducibility in eco/evo, an in the context of other dsciplines?</description>

      <description>Planning the projects and the scope of the Phd (and the format for the thesis):
 Perfectly acceptable to have disparate projects / papers comprising the thesis, and bound together with a good introduction and conclusion. Don’t have to choose between different projects.  Good to try and sit with that tension, and not having to resolve it by having a neat / tightly fitting narrative thesis.

      <description>To date:
Have been trying to determine the scope of the project. Want to look at the reproducibility of decision support tools
 what elements of existing reproducibility literature apply to this context?
 do we need a new set of criteria? Much of the repro literature especially in ecology seems to be focused on NHST, but this statistical tool is rarely used in decision science, instead it might often rely on the outputs of other studies that utilise them.</description>

      <description>See Steve&amp;rsquo;s guidelines around meta-analysis from medicine. Hannah&amp;rsquo;s criteria. Conservation Biology guidelines. Guidelines / checkpoints are just around transparency. No actual checking of reproducibility.
How do decisions vs. models differ? What is particular about my problem context? values, preferences. Process vs. decision model - problem is often split into two. Decision tools as models more complex, involve not just a model of the system / domain (including decision elements), but capturing objectives, alternatives, eliciting expert judgment, involving many stakeholders.</description>

      <description> Activities in the last week  Trying to map out the landscape of reproducibility, in particular, within ecology.  What is the magnitude of the reproducibility crisis, do people even think we have one? What&amp;rsquo;s being done? Mostly focused on efforts by individuals or research groups, as well as institutional efforts, particularly emerging in the bioinformatics discipline and focusing on computational analysis workflows and data management.
 Is there really a differnce  </description>

Reading: - trying to identify difficulties / issues in modelling applied ecological problems in general - e.g. projecting performance of conservation actions, building the evidence base in restoration ecology as new techniques emerge.
-&amp;gt; aims, trying to identify why reproducibility is important for ecological models / DSTs
defining reproducibility for ecological models (still need to justify this)</description>
