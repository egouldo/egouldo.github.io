      <description>Tasks from last week: Develop QRP list across all methods. Figure out what is general between each of the methods. Then come up with a list of QRPs specific to the method under consideration. Also think about the overarching decision / analytic process for each of the methods. Could the QRP occur at multiple points along the workflow / model building pipeline? Sampling protocol - begin writing code, journal selection. Think about elicitation measures, what they could be, and how they could be the same across each of the methods  Other things to discuss today:</description>

      <description>QRPs for non-hypothesis testing research in Ecology and Conservation Decision Making Problem and Background:
The reproducibility literature has focused exclusively on hypothesis-testing, whether that be Bayesian or frequentist. This also applies to initial research focusing on ecology and evolution. However, Fidler (2016) correctly identifies that in applied ecological research, particularly in conservation science, non-hypothesis testing methods, such as decision-theory, cost-effectiveness analysis, optimization and other scientific computing methods are common. These approaches come with their own set of reproducibility issues.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2, QRPs Scope Trying to cover the scope of the entire decision process might be too large for just one chapter. Just examining QRPs for system modelling is quite a task. PV suggested restricting the focus to decision tools and focussing on one application area, such as conservation planning / reserve design. This would also give more traction and uptake among ecologists. Conservation planning isn&amp;rsquo;t using the term &amp;lsquo;reproducibility&amp;rsquo; to describe their problems.</description>

      <title>PhD Research Proposal: Reproducibility and Transparency of Decisions in Ecology and Conservation</title>

      <description>Keywords:
 conservation decision-making ecology reproducibility structured decision-making  Introduction Successful biodiversity conservation and management is underpinned by effective and robust decision-making (Mukherjee et al. 2018). Decision-makers are tasked with allocating limited resources in the face of uncertainty about the effectiveness of alternative management interventions, and incomplete or inadequate scientific information. Moreover, environmental decisions often must be made in complex socio-economic and political contexts, with multiple stakeholders and multiple and/or competing objectives.</description>

      <description>Timeline   Milestones Milestones are documented in the RHD manual, page 4: https://app.lms.unimelb.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-6166800-dt-content-rid-24849943_3/orgs/COM_01654/RHD%20Handbook%20v%202017%2008%2016%20LMS%20version%202.pdf
Candidature and Confirmation: Probationary Candidate: You start your PhD as a probationary candidate and within 12 months (we recommend the ideal time of 9 to 10 months) you will go through the confirmation procedure, formalising your candidature. Purpose of Confirmation: The main purpose of the confirmation process is to determine if you have developed a detailed research plan together with your supervisor(s), to assess whether this research plan meets the requirements of the degree, and to assess if adequate progress has been made.</description>

      <description>I need to start thinking about how we define reproducibility for a) ecological models b) ecological models in the context of decision support.
Reviewing Fiona&amp;rsquo;s article on metaresearch on ecology would be a good place to start thinking about reproducibility in ecology.
-&amp;gt; Reproducibility in ecology&amp;hellip; why important? &amp;ldquo;the inherent complexity of the inference chain needed to advance ecology as well as the importance of ecological results to challenges important to society&amp;rdquo; https://eco.</description>

      <description>Libby has suggested an idea for the first chapter. It would be a data-based review of reproducibility issues facing decision support tools and ecological models. It would require not simply applying existing criteria for reproducibility, but would require generating criteria appropriate to DST&amp;rsquo;s and ecological models. Maybe some existing criteria apply. Maybe some don&amp;rsquo;t.
First chapter initial steps:
 identify why reproducibility is important for ecological models / decision support tools Generate a list of reproducibility criteria: - review issues facing devt of ecological models - review literature on reproducibility in ecology / conservation in general Generate a set of DST&amp;rsquo;s / models to apply the list to Figure out a way of scoring the models Apply the list and score the models  Questions:</description>

      <description>Readings: Reproducibility – how to define for this context. Ecology / decision support tools.
Reproducibility of ecological models used for decision support tools.
Interested in the sorts of decisions that we make as modellers… e.g. what performance measures do we use, there are so many different ways of valuing the objectives. And depending on which measure you use, you might judge the outcomes of each of the different strategies under consideration differently….</description>
