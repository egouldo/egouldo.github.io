      <description>Morgan (2014) present a review of expert elicitation methods for decision support in public policy. I reviewed this paper looking for information on how to design my methods for the expert eliciation of judgments about the consequences of particular research practices on the risk of a type I error in models used in decision support in ecology and conservation.
 I draw on relevant literature and 35 y of personal experience in designing and conducting substantively detailed expert elicitations, to suggest when it does and does not make sense to perform elicitations, how they should be designed and conducted, and how I believe the results should and should not be used.</description>

      <description>Problem The authors aim to address the problem of false conclusions arisng during inference of joint species distribution models – specifically, false conclusions of biotic interactions.
Approach The authors conduct a review of joint species distribution modelling to identify (from caveats and other issues ear-marked in the source papers) potential factors that confound interpretation of analyses. Next, they develop a series of questions that can be asked by the analyst and also the reviewer to guide interpretation of conclusions – are the conclusions about biotic interactions plausible?</description>

      <description>Summary This paper is a systematic review (or ‘methodological review’ in their tersm) of both QRPs and bad modelling practice in structural equation modelling within the field of communication. They don’t use the term ‘Questionable Research Practices’, however, they do explicitly look at practices falling under the QRP banner, including cherry-picking, HARKing, and researcher degrees of freedom. Importantly, this paper is really useful to me because they examine these questionable research practices in a modelling framework outside of the non-hypothetico-deductive scientific model.</description>

      <description>Problem: Why is transparency and reproducibility of environmental models important? Transparency and reproducibility are quintessential for facilitating assessment of model quality and suitability by both peer-reviewers, readers, and future users:  Page 1, 2018-06-20:  Environmental models are in fact applications of shared theories on how real-world systems are functioning.
 Because “Environmental models are in fact applications of shared theories on how real-world systems are functioning”, it is essential that “the underlying scientific theories they need to be evaluated and discussed among peers.</description>

“Transformation process” of science communication is susceptible to confusion and corruption, has triggered both reflection and meta-research in other disciplines.
Forstmeier et al [8]:
Individual research practice is embedded in a broader culture, and promoite conditions of publication bias and type 1 errors. ‘Questionable research practices’ are fostered under conditions of publication bias, inflating false postive rates in the literature.</description>

      <description>Gardner et al. (2018) add to knowledge-doing gap literature by defining and exemplifying what they call “Decision Complacency”
 The non-use of evidence or systematic processes to make decisions.
 Contextualising decision complacency in the knowledge-doing gap:
Researcher-practitioner divide: the case where researchers do not meet the needs of practitioners such that the information provided by conservation scientists does not allow decision-makers or practitioners to make sufficiently evidence-based decisions Evidence Complacency: Sutherland and Wordley (2017) describe a different angle of the researcher-practitioner divide where practitioners don’t use or seek available evidence, and/or don’t test the impact of their actions.</description>

      <description>The open data movement has the capacity to provide new and powerful insights into complex systems, in ecology and evolution. However, in ecology and evolution there has not been great uptake / implementation of open data to the extent seen in other disciplines (e.g. medicine, climate sciences).
Why open data?
 identify broader eco evo processes across space, time, species reanalysing data using new statistical approaches error checking using existing data to answer new questions era of the Anthropocene: large, complicated questions with high degree of uncertainty requires combined data from multiple sources, and multidsciplinary data synthesis.</description>

      <description>Why do we replicate? Assess the validity of prior findings probe the generality of those findings   Levels of replication Exact (also known as “direct”): highest fidelity to the original work. But in ecology, usually can only be ‘close’ replications. Partial: there is a spectrum of partial replications, from close to limited. These have slight procedural differences. Conceptual: uses distinctly different study designs to test the same hypotheses. Quasi-replication (cross-species or system)   Assessing validity  Probing generality Conceptual replications: when results concur, we can define generality.</description>

Demonstrate that ecology and evolution as disciplines are at risk of a having low rates of reproducibility, aka a &amp;lsquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rsquo; as others have termed it. The paper sets out to identify the different ways in which ecology is likely to have a reproducibility problem.</description>

Problem / background and paper goals Page 2 [@French:2012di] describes three types of expert elicitation problems. The third forms the focus of the paper:
 The expert problem: where the decision-maker does not have the domain knowledge and elicits judgments from a group of experts. The group decision problem: where the expert group itself is jointly responseible for the decision.</description>

      <description>(Madin et al. 2008)
Why are ontologies relevant to ecology? Issue of effectively locating scientific data is hampered because our current approaches for describing it rely on the “ad hoc use of user-supplied keywords, and do not ensure that such terms are defined and used consistently.” The same is true when searching for relevant data, “users supply their own search terms, which are then matched against keywords assigned to datasets”. Ecology is particularly prone to this problem, and many terms often have multiple and variable meanings in different contexts.</description>

(2017) Using structured decision-making to set restoration objectives when multiple values and preferences exist. Restoration Ecology. 25, 858–865.
Problem: achieving restoration targets is impeded by difficulty in identifying and working towards targets, because objective setting is beset by multiple / conflicting values and preferences, and there are often time-lags in a restoration action and its desired outcome.</description>

      <description>\cite{MEE3:MEE312855}
Problem
More and more indices of diversity are created with time. Accurately quantifying functional diversity is important because we want to know how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning.
Functional diversity is the &amp;ldquo;values and range of functionally important traits in a community&amp;rdquo;.
The authors describe four dimensions to functional diversity:
 functional richness evenness divergence redundancy  And they each characterise how organisms interact with ecosystem functioning.
Although the choice of index should be guided by the functional diversity component of interest, there are multiple indices available for each component, and then there are synthetic indices that summarise all four components as a whole.</description>

New techniques, approaches, and technologies are emerging and being applied in habitat restoration. This is because restoration goals are shifting towards resilience and dynamism, and because the need for efficient resource use is of increasing concern.
The paper serves as an introduction / review to the special issue of the journal.</description>
