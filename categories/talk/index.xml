      <description>QRP research is NHST focussed To date, there has been limited research on QRPs and other aspects of reproducibility for non-NHST research.
Partly because: The majority of QRP research has been undertaken in Psychology, where almost all statistical testing is NHST. But this is not true for other fields eg, in applied ecology and conservation, my area of expertise, where we often use predictive modelling to systematically inform environmental decision-making. Instead, we use decision-theoretic frameworks, return-on-investment analyses, Bayesian Network models.</description>

      <description>Upcoming events: Statistical Society of Australia (SSA), Biostatistics bonanza. August 23.
Sue Finch: “Back to basics? Identifying educational needs through statistical consulting” People who come to consulting come with real need - come with an applied problem. How can we use this to inform new generation of statistical training for researchers?
Break down research cycle using PPDAC cycle used within statistical education (Wild and Pfannkuch). Process of statistical thinking when carrying out a statistical inquiry.</description>

      <description>Institutional road blocks against full reproducibility - methods sections are insufficient. But good software practice is helpful for future you, your labmates when you leave.
