<h2>Self-correction</h2>
<p>Simine’s meta-science research: How to become more credible science? What does that mean?</p>
<p>Demarcation problem - science diff. from pseudo-science, how? Merton’s norms:
- self-correction
- how do you know? What does that mean? How would you design a self-correcting system? what values, priorities to be instilled?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Universalism
- claim validity should not depend on status of person making it.</li>
<li>Communality
- open access, no secrecy.</li>
<li>Disinterestedness
- should report what ever they find regardless of whether it harms yourself or other sceintists</li>
<li>Organised skepticism
- nothing sacred. everything is up for being scrutinised.</li>

<p>All values that don’t come naturally to humans! How do we help people live up to these values?!</p>

<h2>Progress review (on self-correcting mechanisms)</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>False discovery rate is unacceptably high
- many studies difficult, impossible to replicate
- p-vbalue distribution unrealistic</li>
</ol>
<p>How did it happen?
2. Common research practices violate rules of NHST and increase false positive rate.</p>
<p>Common confusion that rate of false positives among all positive findings (false discovery rate) is 5%. But actually it’s when there is no effect, but you find an effect (column-wise in the type I / type II error diagram).</p>
<div id="false-discovery-rate" class="section level3">
<h3>False discovery rate</h3>
<p>46% replicability rate (high quality replications). 54% False discovery rate (is false positive rate actually higher? Optimistic take?). but put wide confidence interval around that.</p>
<p>Pre-registration, removing publication bias: recent study assessing all registered reports (mostly in psychology). When you remove publication bias null finding rate increases.</p>
<p>Consistent with survey asking scientists whether there is a replication crisis (were they saying in their field or in other fields ?!?!).</p>
</div>
<div id="distribution-of-p-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Distribution of p-values</h3>
<p>decent power + real effect, most effects should be detected.</p>
<p>P-values just below the threshold <em>should</em> be rare!</p>
<p>When you reject the null you are in theory drawing from H1 distribution… and it should be RARE that you land on .04.</p>
<p>no scenario where consistently getting p-values between .01 - .05. SO if you observe that, which we are, then likely that some form of bias is going on – not drawing from H1 (as we should be).</p>
</div>
<div id="common-practice-violates-rules-of-nhst" class="section level3">
<h3>Common practice violates rules of NHST</h3>
<p>If you follow rules, you should be in the left-column.
MAKE PREDICTION, and THEN TEST!!! Not taught in statistical education.</p>
<p>Common problem: cannot test the hypothesis using data that you generated the data from!
By violating this rule, you’re pushing things from top row to bottom row.</p>
<p>Did you get effect you predicted? Y- publish, N, test something else and then HARK.</p>
<p>Arguments justifying these QRPs
- Theories are constraining
- E.G. ANdrew Gelman’s blog (feb 2018)</p>
<p>Not a conscious act!!!</p>
<p>Correllational research has own way to p-hack. Self-logic: amplifying signal and muting the noise (using outcome of analysis to decide which was the right analysis). Some decisions are justified – but the key is if the decision is amde after seeing the data, then it removes the error-control properties of NHST.</p>
<p>If we followed the rules we would know how much type I and type II error we are willing to tolerate. But when QRPing, we push results into the bottom row. How big a problem depends on which column we’re in (true or false real effect, but we don’t know!). “Les Miller: Under-substantiated positives” EVEN if really true. Have true belief, but it’s not justified. Exaggerated effect size. Not replicated with same sample size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="credibility-revolution" class="section level2">
<h2>Credibility revolution</h2>
<p>Motivated by bad news. But strong incentive to change things. Humans are the bug, we are introducing the counter-norms (i.e. to Merton’s).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Transparency…. but not enoguh</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>credibility depends on it.</li>
<li>papers are not the scholarship, but are the “advertising” for the scholarship.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Strong methods</li>
</ol>
<p>Information assymetry (buyer vs. seller) – then the buyers lose trust in the entire market. Whenever there is info. assymetry and the consumer <em>knows</em> this, they lose trust in science. Vazire: quality uncertainty erodes trust in science.</p>
<p>Transparency can lead to criticism and correction, which is necessary for credibility… but doesn’t guarantee it. Transparency gives critics ammunition. Exposing shoddiness of work. So we must pair increased transparency with really strong methods. Robust research methods (e.g. construct validity) need to be part of the discussion. If can’t test repeatedly (replicate), then your confidence should be lower. If can’t provide these things, then claim should be more circumscribed.</p>
<p>Oath for scientists based on Merton’s norms?</p>
<p>Importantly —- the problem is bigger than individuals. Gatekeepers provide the incentives for poor research practice / QRPs.</p>
<p>Gervais et al (2015) SPPS. Comparison of two researchers using different sample size. Researcher A: have HUGE file drawer (83%) – willing to file draw that or will you p-hack given pressure to publish? But R-A has lower power. There <em>ARE</em> techniques to compare different research practices to highlight which studies are more rigorous work.</p>
<p>Changing the way the scorecards are presented.
key actors are journal editors. Their behaviur influences all the other gate-keepers. Editor level? Such a strong pressure to choose editors who are very well established in that field… don’t choose critics of that field, or who are on fringe. So one solution: new journals emerging instead of trying to change existing journals.</p>
<p>But researcher B never exists! But there is increasing emergence of B, due to open science practices.. improved transparency, etc. But small set of samples is needed to get some diagnostic information from the P-curve, so it’s still a pretty good tool for giving you a picture of what sort of practices a researcher is using. Don’t just look at the ressearcher who pre-registered, but look at the claims the researcher is making in the pre-registered studiues.</p>
<p>Internal meta-analysis (within papers with multiple studies): LOTS of potential for flexibility and over-fitting across all studies. But that extra aggregation will be even more difficult to understand what exactly the authors did.</p>
<p>Rob: need empirical evidence examining estimation methods.</p>

<h3>Exploratory experiments</h3>
<p>A number of experiments, including important ones, do not correspond to what we would call hypothesis testing. It is directed towards particular goals.. e.g. an empirical regularity where there appears to be none.
not driven by particular well-formed theories… none to be worked on <em>yet</em> found in new stages of research in a new field (often)</p>
<p>Friedrich Steinle: “Exploratory experiments”.</p>
<p>Aim of experiment is to amplify tthe effect, to demonstrate that it exists. We have phenomena that we can see, but cannot account for it. Concepts that make that phenomena intelligible to us doesn’t exist yet… and is hence pre-linguistic.</p>
<p>Is this what a lot of structured decision making / decision analytic papers in conservation sci are doing? demonstrating the benefit of the tool / system?</p>
<p>Rheinberger – none of the dominant philosophies of science matched up with his experience of experimental science.</p>
<p>Hypoth testing is not at the centre, or the rule of experimental research. “Epistemic thing” is the object of scientific investigation… which we do not yet fully understand. Thigns which were the object of your study can then become to be used as objects of future studies.</p>

<h3>Investigative Pathways</h3>
<p>The long-lived venture of research. Not constituted by single experiments but by chains of ongoing activity. Leading the researcher in directions they did not forsee. Studies of lab notebooks e.g. of Krebs demonstrate this! All trace of this vanishes from the article. Scientific inquiry is decision-laden. Not is it true.. what do I do with that? Causes you to re-orient your experimental work in some new direction.</p>
<p>Notion of method is so foreign here.. can’t perform the next step until you’ve made the previous.. but the step does not determine the next.. might suggest one but doesn’t tell you exactly the next step.</p>

<div id="lessons-from-the-turn-to-practice" class="section level2">
<h2>Lessons from the Turn to Practice</h2>
<p>Scientific inquiry is more strategic than methodological – (not that methods don’t come into play).</p>
<p>Executing a strategy you <em>use</em> and <em>arrange</em> in a unique way existing methods or techniques. Dictated by the skillset of the scientist, availability of those tools and other extrinsic and intrinsic conditions. Strategy <em>(should)</em> provide a means of circumnavigating <em>or</em> changing the goals in the course of research. Scientists know where the sources for their mode of inquiry are.. and design their epistemic strategy to get around them. This is what makes science rational. In the course of execution, strategy and ongoing goals are changed in course… We begin with a strategy, but the strategy might evolve. There is no universal scientific method and <em>this is the hallmark of scientific rationality</em>.</p>
<p>What if we are decision-making under uncertainty? where does this fit in Kristian’s understanding of what science is?</p>
<p>Where does the rationality come into the improvisation of the strategy? i.e. how do you know science is being done well? it cannot be by method. Anyone can hypothesis test… whether you can do it well does not depend on method.. but on practice. Must be immersed in practice. “Primacy of praxis”. Those who know how to do, know how to criticise – plea for strengthening communities of open science within particular disciplines. but can outsider tell if the discipline is credible?</p>
<p>Why do folk cling to hypothesis testing, and in particular NHST? Is that because it gives them a established, well-accepted method? Hailed as superior mode of inquiry… but sometimes have failed!</p>
<p>What is a science then?? If no universal scientific method. Not about labels, but whether normative approaches to getting to that knowledge….
Do we need a set of measures in order to define in the first place? Doesn’t matter.. it’s more about judgments of epistemic reliability rather than the label of “science”.</p>
