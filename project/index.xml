      <description>Timeline   Milestones Milestones are documented in the RHD manual, page 4: https://app.lms.unimelb.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-6166800-dt-content-rid-24849943_3/orgs/COM_01654/RHD%20Handbook%20v%202017%2008%2016%20LMS%20version%202.pdf
Candidature and Confirmation: Probationary Candidate: You start your PhD as a probationary candidate and within 12 months (we recommend the ideal time of 9 to 10 months) you will go through the confirmation procedure, formalising your candidature. Purpose of Confirmation: The main purpose of the confirmation process is to determine if you have developed a detailed research plan together with your supervisor(s), to assess whether this research plan meets the requirements of the degree, and to assess if adequate progress has been made.</description>

      <description>Max 5 pages, 3000 - 4000 words. Send to committee and cc’d to rhd-biosciences@unimelb.edu.au
 are topic and aims well defined and achievable are the appropriate methods established or will they need to be developed does the student understand the relevant literature are there any intellectual property issues current / potential EHS issues?  Introduction  well-referenced intro that explains scientific context of project (1 - 3 pages)  Science is a cumulative process building upon previous research to develop knowledge, however, this process requires that the findings are both real, and replicable (Nakagawa and Parker 2015).</description>

      <description>Goal I want to generate a “roadmap” of the sources of bias and questionable research practices (QRPs) that I think are frequently encountered when developing D in applied ecology / conservation. These biases will reduce the reproducibility of of a given decision support tool. Identifying where in the DST development process particular biases are likely to occur should serve as a launching point for proposing solutions towards minimising their occurrence and therefore increasing the reproducibility of DSTs.</description>
