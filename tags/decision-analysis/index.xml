      <description>Application domain: Microbiology decision support for predicting food borne Bacteria growth and reduce the need for microbiological testing. Approach/framework: risk assessment and decision-analytic framework.
Aims and objectives of the paper:
 The focus of this paper is not the above interpreted risk, assigned to an a-posteriori event, but the risk of an a-priory decision, that we also call choice or bet in what follows.
  In this paper we explain, backed by examples, why predictive models should be used in combination with a cost-bene fit assessment.</description>

 The expert problem: where the decision-maker does not have the domain knowledge and elicits judgments from a group of experts. The group decision problem: where the expert group itself is jointly responseible for the decision.</description>
