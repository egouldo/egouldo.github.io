      <description>The open data movement has the capacity to provide new and powerful insights into complex systems, in ecology and evolution. However, in ecology and evolution there has not been great uptake / implementation of open data to the extent seen in other disciplines (e.g. medicine, climate sciences).
Why open data?
 identify broader eco evo processes across space, time, species reanalysing data using new statistical approaches error checking using existing data to answer new questions era of the Anthropocene: large, complicated questions with high degree of uncertainty requires combined data from multiple sources, and multidsciplinary data synthesis.</description>

      <description>Why do we replicate? Assess the validity of prior findings probe the generality of those findings   Levels of replication Exact (also known as “direct”): highest fidelity to the original work. But in ecology, usually can only be ‘close’ replications. Partial: there is a spectrum of partial replications, from close to limited. These have slight procedural differences. Conceptual: uses distinctly different study designs to test the same hypotheses. Quasi-replication (cross-species or system)   Assessing validity  Probing generality Conceptual replications: when results concur, we can define generality.</description>
