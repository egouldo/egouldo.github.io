      <description>Morgan (2014) present a review of expert elicitation methods for decision support in public policy. I reviewed this paper looking for information on how to design my methods for the expert eliciation of judgments about the consequences of particular research practices on the risk of a type I error in models used in decision support in ecology and conservation.
 I draw on relevant literature and 35 y of personal experience in designing and conducting substantively detailed expert elicitations, to suggest when it does and does not make sense to perform elicitations, how they should be designed and conducted, and how I believe the results should and should not be used.</description>
