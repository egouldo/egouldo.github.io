      <description>Problem Replication effort:
There are many sources of error (as to why claim is not supported, or approximate result[significance in same direction, effect size]):
 actual data is not reflected in code files Can’t match the environment: Missing packages etc, etc, etc  One model of addressing these issues is using Docker:
Docker goes some way to solving this…. BUT: It’s really hard to get docker up and running - you need specialised knowledge of how to get your code and data etc.</description>

      <description>(Madin et al. 2008)
Why are ontologies relevant to ecology? Issue of effectively locating scientific data is hampered because our current approaches for describing it rely on the “ad hoc use of user-supplied keywords, and do not ensure that such terms are defined and used consistently.” The same is true when searching for relevant data, “users supply their own search terms, which are then matched against keywords assigned to datasets”. Ecology is particularly prone to this problem, and many terms often have multiple and variable meanings in different contexts.</description>
