      <description>Libby has suggested an idea for the first chapter. It would be a data-based review of reproducibility issues facing decision support tools and ecological models. It would require not simply applying existing criteria for reproducibility, but would require generating criteria appropriate to DST&amp;rsquo;s and ecological models. Maybe some existing criteria apply. Maybe some don&amp;rsquo;t.
First chapter initial steps:
 identify why reproducibility is important for ecological models / decision support tools Generate a list of reproducibility criteria: - review issues facing devt of ecological models - review literature on reproducibility in ecology / conservation in general Generate a set of DST&amp;rsquo;s / models to apply the list to Figure out a way of scoring the models Apply the list and score the models  Questions:</description>
