      <description>QRP research is NHST focussed To date, there has been limited research on QRPs and other aspects of reproducibility for non-NHST research.
Partly because: The majority of QRP research has been undertaken in Psychology, where almost all statistical testing is NHST. But this is not true for other fields eg, in applied ecology and conservation, my area of expertise, where we often use predictive modelling to systematically inform environmental decision-making. Instead, we use decision-theoretic frameworks, return-on-investment analyses, Bayesian Network models.</description>

      <description>Despite a growing body of large-scale meta-analyses across many different disciplines, debate as to whether there is a “crisis” persists. Fanelli et al. (2018) use a failed replication of a large-scale meta-analysis to argue that the “crisis” is mistaken, and should instead be re-branded as a narrative of “epochal changes and empowerment of science” (Jamieson 2018). In a ‘post-truth’ era of ‘alternative-facts’, how scientists communicate research on the robustness of science and its self-correcting mechanisms is certainly important (Sutherland and Wordley 2017).</description>
