      <description>QRP research is NHST focussed To date, there has been limited research on QRPs and other aspects of reproducibility for non-NHST research.
Partly because: The majority of QRP research has been undertaken in Psychology, where almost all statistical testing is NHST. But this is not true for other fields eg, in applied ecology and conservation, my area of expertise, where we often use predictive modelling to systematically inform environmental decision-making. Instead, we use decision-theoretic frameworks, return-on-investment analyses, Bayesian Network models.</description>

      <description>Unpacking what this (“reproducibility issues”) means … what do we need to know? what is my task a. how to measure the likely reproducibility of a study b. what is the function / role of different types of replications in terms of what they tell us about the broader state of the literature (validity, generalisations) c.
how widespread the reproducibility issues identified in part I. The work from the first aim will help to inform the scoping rules and coding criteria for the systematic review.</description>

      <title>QRP and Biases Roadmap</title>

      <description>Goal I want to generate a “roadmap” of the sources of bias and questionable research practices (QRPs) that I think are frequently encountered when developing D in applied ecology / conservation. These biases will reduce the reproducibility of of a given decision support tool. Identifying where in the DST development process particular biases are likely to occur should serve as a launching point for proposing solutions towards minimising their occurrence and therefore increasing the reproducibility of DSTs.</description>
